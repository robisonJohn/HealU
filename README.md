# Title
Heal U

# Description
<p>The goal of Heal U is to enable users to post information about their daily emotional health and well-being in an anonymous manner. Users will make a post with three
components:</p>
<ol>
  <li>How are you feeling: good or bad?</li>
  <li>Can you elaborate on this feeling? i.e. frustrated, excited, annoyed, etc.</li>
  <li>On a scale of 1-10, how strongly are you experiencing this feeling?</li>
  <li>Why do you think you're feeling this way?</li>
  
</ol>

# MVP
<p>The goal for the MVP is to have an application that takes the following items as input</p>
<ul>
  <li>How you are feeling today? (String) </li>
  <li>How strongly are you feeling this way (Number, range 1-10)</li>
  <li>Reason for feeling this way (String) </li>
  <li>Date of input (Date Object)</li>
</ul>
<p>Post this new data to Airtable using axios</p>
<p>Render this data to the DOM</p>

# Post-MVP
<p>Enable the users to choose emojis instead of typing in strings to communicate their feelings</p>
<p>Visualize the data in a histogram format (to show relative feeling frequencies) and also a scatterplot (to show the feelings over time)</p>
<p>Enable the users to edit / delete prior inputs</p>
<p>Implement Bootstrap, time permitting</p>

# SWOT Analysis
<p>Strengths: I am intrinsically super passionate about and interested in this topic, so this will make the overall process more enjoyable. When something is fun,
we tend to work harder / do better work. </p>
<p>Weaknesses: I am still a bit fuzzy on the react component hierarchy, so I will need to iron this weakness out before I really start building.</p>
<p>Opportunity: This is really an opportunity for me to aggregate all of my react knowledge and show case what I have learned the past few weeks!</p>
<p>Threats: I failed to implement a solid idea the first time around, so time is already against me. I need to be smart about how I proceed and be as efficient as 
possible so that I may complete the MVP in time.</p>
